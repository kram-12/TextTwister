# TextTwister

**TextTwister** is a command-line game that challenges your word-solving skills using **stack** and **queue** data structures. Players unscramble jumbled words by strategically applying **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** and **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** operations, enhancing both logical thinking and understanding of fundamental data structures.

## 🎮 Gameplay

In **TextTwister**, you can perform the following operations:

* **Push:** Move a letter from the jumbled word to the stack
* **Pop:** Move a letter from the stack to the queue
* **Enqueue:** Move a letter from the jumbled word to the queue
* **Dequeue:** Move a letter from the queue to the stack
* **Reset:** Restart the current word
* **Check:** Verify if the current arrangement is correct

Advance through levels by solving increasingly challenging words.
